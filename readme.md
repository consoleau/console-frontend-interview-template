# Overview

This repo consists of a trivial class and mocha test. The purpose of this module is to verify that a given laptop environment is setup to run our code challenge questions before a technical interview.

# Prerequisites

1. node.js version 6.0 or greater

# Steps to Verify

1. `git clone git@github.com:consoleau/console-frontend-interview-template.git`
1. `cd console2-frontend-interview-template`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm test`


    At this point you should see this output and know that your laptop can run our code challenge env:
        
      Foo Test
        âœ“ fn1 returns 'BAR'
      1 passing (8ms)
