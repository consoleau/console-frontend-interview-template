# Overview

This repo consists of a trivial class and mocha test. The purpose of this module is to verify that a given laptop environment is setup to run our code challenge questions before a technical interview.

# Prerequisites

1. node.js version 6.0 or greater

# Steps to Verify

1. `git clone git@github.com:consoleau/console-frontend-interview-template.git`
1. `cd console-frontend-interview-template`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm test`
    1. If you see this output (or similar), then your environment is ready! :

```
    Foo Test
       âœ“ fn1 returns 'BAR'
    1 passing (Xms)
```   

If you don't see the 1 passing message above then there is an issue with the install, likely the node version, that needs to be sorted before the tech interview.

This is for us to send to you. You've probably already read this ;)

Part of the interview will involve one or more coding challenges.
 
 * The coding challenge are completed in Javascript 
     * the suite supports ES6 but ES6 knowledge is not required
 * The interviewer will help as necessary by providing hints and guidelines.
 * The session will run for 40-60 minutes  
 

You have the option of bringing your own hardware or using a provided laptop.
If you prefer your own environment that you are familiar with, then please ensure that your environment has some dependencies pre-installed.
The list of dependencies and a mechanism to verify the dependencies can be found here :
